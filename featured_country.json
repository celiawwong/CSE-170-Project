		"cuisine": "Thai cuisine blends five fundamental tastes: sweet, spicy, sour, bitter, and salty. Thai cuisine is heavily inspired by Chinese cuisine, especially Thai street food, soups and stir fry dishes. Some common ingredients used in Thai cuisine include garlic, chillies, lime juice, lemon grass, sugar, and fish sauce. The staple food in Thailand is rice, particularly jasmine variety rice (also known as 'hom Mali' rice) which is included at almost every meal. Thailand was long the world's largest exporter of rice, and Thais domestically consume over 100 kg of milled rice per person per year."
